##Findings - Clutch Time FG%##
  -Only once did a player that won MVP finish in the top 10 of clutch time FG% for that given season, Steph Curry('15-16)
  -During the 2015-2016 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves had 2 players finish in the top 10 for clutch time FG% despite 
    finsihing with a record of 25-38 (24th in the league)
  -There were 16 occurences across the 5 seasons where a player finished in the top 10 of clutch time FG% 
    and their team did not qualify for the playoffs. Reinforcing the point that basketball is a team sport and rarely does one player 
    have such a great impact on a team
    

##Findings - Clutch Time FG% vs. Non-Clutch Time FG%##
  -Deron Williams('15-16), Jayson Tatum('17-18), and Nikola Jokic('19-20) all shot ~10% better during clutch time in their respective seasons. 
    Both Tatum and Jokic's teams made it to the conference finals in those years and their team finsihed with a winning percentage above 60% in clutch time.
  -Demar Derozan('16-17), Harrison Barnes('17-18), and CJ McCollum('19-20) all shot ~10% worse during clutch time in their respective seasons. 
    All these players played on teams that either did not make the playoffs or did not make it past the 2nd round of the playoffs and all 3 teams 
    finsihed with a winning percentage below 60% in clutch time.
    
##Findings - Clutch Time 3P%##
  -Steph Curry('15-16) finished in the top 10 of both clutch time FG% and cluch time 3P%. This was the same season he finished as the 
    first ever unanimous MVP and his team finished 73-9 overall, the best regular season record in NBA history. It's no coicidence that his teammate, 
    Klay Thompson, finished just 3 spots below him. Many consider the two to be the best shooting backcourt of all-time.
  -The 2 highest clutch time 3P%'s belong to Terry Rozier('19-20) and Wayne Ellington('17-18), neither being household names. 
    As the league moves into more positionless basketball and players become more skilled, 3-pointers are more often taken off the catch rather than the dribble. 
    Which is why you see less familiar names like Troy Daniels, Buddy Hield, and Rodney Hood show up on these top 10 lists for any given season. 
    They are what the NBA deems "3-point specialists" or "3 & D Players".
    
##Findings - Clutch Time Winning%##
  -While an NBA game is 48 minutes and usually contains between 95-105 possesions for each team, you can really boil a game down to a few key possesions. 
    These possessions often happnen during clutch time and can really make or break a team's season.
      -For example, in 2015-2016 the Utah Jazz had a record of 28-39 in clutch time games and finsihed with an overall record of 40-42 and finished one 
       game back of the Houston Rocktes, missing the playoffs. That means, out of the 82 games they played, 67(81%) of them were within 5 points with 5 minutes 
       or less in the 4th quarter or overtime. If they just went .500 in those games, they would've made the playoffs. Fast forward to the next season, 
       and the Utah Jazz finished with an overall record of 51-31, good for the 4th best record in a very competitive western confernece. What was the difference 
       between the 2015-16 and 2016-2017 Utah Jazz? In 2016-2017, they finshed with a record of 45-32 in games that featured clutch time situations. While there are 
       a number of outside factors that play into a team's record at the end of a season(injuries, strength of schedule, home/road split), simply winning your close 
       games can make a huge difference in the end result.
  -Golden State finished with the best overall clutch time winning percentage for the 5 year stretch we looked at despite finishing dead last in 2019-2020 with a 
  winning percentage of 23%. This confirms what many believe to be the best stretch in NBA history for a team from 2015-2019, which saw Golden State make 5 straight 
  finals appearances, winning 3 of them.
  -With the rise of sports gambling in recent years, information such as this can be useful for people looking to place bets on team's win totals before the season. 
  If a team finsihed with a good record, but a large portion of those wins came during clutch time, do you expect that team to continue to win at that pace? And vice versa? 
  History tells us that teams often regress or progress back to the mean after years like that.
  
##Findings - Clutch Time Assist:Turnover Ratio##
  -Overall teams with a high win percentage generally have a high assist:turnover ratio year to year. There is little evidence that this is an indicator of a good team though, 
    as a number of teams with a low clutch time win percentage finished at or near the top of the league in clutch time assist:turnover ratio.
  -3 out of the 5 years for which we looked at, the team with the highest assist:turnover ratio had one of the worst clutch time winning percentages. Perhaps this might lead 
    one to believe that isolation basketabll leads to better results when the game is on the line since the ball is going to be in your best player's hands.
  -The Houston Rockets('18-19) finished last in the league in clutch time assist:turnover ratio with a ratio of ~1. This is due in large part to having one of the most 
    isolation heavy players in NBA history in James Harden. Given Harden's historically high usage rate that year(39.6%), one can conclude that the ball dominance of Harden 
    prevented the offense from moving the ball in clutch time situations. More times than not, the Rockets offense in clutch time involved Harden going one-on-one and the 
    possesion either ending in a shot attempt or turnover by Harden.
    
##Findings - Clutch Time Turnover Margin##
  -4 out of 5 seasons, the team with the best turnover margin finished with a clutch time winning percentage below 50%. Twice, that team was the Sacramento Kings ('17-18,'18-19).
  -3 out of 5 seasons saw the team that won the NBA finals finish with a negative turnover margin
  -The Houston Rockets('18-19) finished last in the league in clutch time assist:turnover ratio while also finsihing dead last in clutch time turnover margin. While it is 
    very atypical for a Chris Paul team to have such a bad turnover margin, this was probably more due to the fact that the Houston Rocket's coach, Mike Dantoni, is known for 
    his high powered offensive scheme and vastly underperforming defensively. The Rockets, not being as engaged on the defensive end that season, were very bad at forcing 
    turnovers.
