# NBA-Clutch-Time-Analysis-Project

I had the oppportunity to complete a project for my Data Programming in Python class that analyzed both players and teams performance during clutch time from 2015-2020

My analysis looked at the following questions:
- Which players had the highest FG% and 3P% during clutch time each year
  - Is their performance during non-clutch time in line with their performance during clutch time?
    - i.e. Do they rise to the occasion in big moments or fall short?
  - Do any players appear on both lists?
    - What does that say about a player if they do or do not appear on both lists?    
- Which teams have the highest winning percentage during clutch time each year
  - Are there certain factors tht contribute to this winning percentage?
    - Low turnover rate, high assst rate, etc.
